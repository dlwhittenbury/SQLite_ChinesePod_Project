In Chinese, you often encounter single characters that have multiple related meanings. This has the potential to confuse learners because sometimes it is hard to make connections between component characters and their meanings within multiple-character words. That's why we created this Character Mind Map series, where we focus on characters and the words they make up.


Today, we're talking about the character 心. You may know its original meaning which is heart, but it's so much more than that! When combined with different words, the character 心 can mean the center, emotion or feelings. Let's check them out!"

这篇文章的第四段提到，表面上看来，皮埃德罗老头好像是在享受操纵机器，好像很快乐，因为熟练掌握了科技而感到很满意，其实，这位工人只是不得不如此，因为，他遇到的人类可能会对他更加苛刻、残酷、隔阂、冷落，更加非难于他，让他觉得与人类相比，不如和机器呆在一起

这里也提醒我们那些受理人员为什么对人不理不睬，为什么态度生硬，他们不是生来就长着一张冷漠的面孔，也许是因为他们所受到的冷遇太多了，尤其是前台的工作人员，总是要求他们职业性的微笑是不人道的，他们也是人，有很多人类有的情绪，如果去找他们办事的人把他们不当人，当机器人来要求，他们也会有很多的负面情绪，于是就冷漠以对。所以，我们在要求对方为我们服务的时候，是否先做到彼此尊重，首先要把对方当着一个人，其次他才是一名服务人员。"

这篇文章的第三段讲述的是，作者去了某个官僚机构办理某种资格证书，在程序上没什么问题，但是总有哪里让人感到不舒服的地方，那就是他们并不进行眼神上的交流，只是很机械的问一些问题，他们彼此之间也很少交流，都不是很友好，甚至很不耐烦，这是为什么呢？，如果你设身处地为他们考虑，站在他们的角度上思考问题，就会知道为什么了。这个问题，我们会在第四部分会讲解。"

在上一个课程，第一段大意是对一些官僚机构的办事效率慢，消极懈怠的工作态度，进行了生动的描述。

而这里第二段内容讲述了人们遭遇了官僚机构的排斥和打压之后，会向往与机器人沟通，因为无论如何，机器人都不会有坏情绪，不会怼人，不会没有耐心，机器人会按照输入的程序认真回答每个问题。可是，你会喜欢和一个没有人性机器人聊天还是你可能宁愿和一个有血有肉怒气冲冲的人说话？

在这里跟大家分享一篇肖遥的专栏文章《人机合一》，这是发表在2017年的《三联生活周刊》上的一篇随笔，文字轻松明快，内容幽默有趣，下面，我们解析一下这篇1000字左右的文章。这篇文章，我们会分为四个部分进行解读，今天我们进行第一个部分的解读：

第一段主要讲了三种类型的办事员或公务员，老Q、小咪、小F，这三种人各自都有自己的特点：老Q是索要贿赂型，小咪是长相好，但态度不好的类型，小F惜墨如金型，他们代表了三种不负责任的公务人员，他们消极怠工，不热爱自己的工作，不愿耐心回答问询，对待顾客冷漠，还不如机器人。

第一段很容易理解，大意就是对一些官僚机构的办事效率慢，消极懈怠的工作态度，进行了生动的描述，希望我们都不要遇到这样的状况，也不要这样对待他人，希望大家都会被生活所善待，也学希望借着这篇文章我们也学会了怎么来应用这些词句。"

As of now, the majority of issues are resolved, but we are still working on fixing the rest, which you can follow here.

In order to fully resolve the issue, we are scheduling a maintenance session this coming Friday which will result in a much-improved experience afterwards.

This is actually something we have been wanting to do for some time, but it's just happening sooner rather than later.

The scheduled downtime to our website will be...

Friday, June 30th at 6 PM (UTC 8) to Saturday Morning 6 AM (UTC 8) 
During this time, the website and apps will not function.

We are sorry for this inconvenience but hope to have a much better service afterwards which will prevent problems like this from happening again.  If you have any comments or concerns, feel free to contact:

A few weeks back we taught a lesson (How To Say: Come Out / Come In) about the direction compliments for ""to go in"" and to ""come out"".  User si1teng2 thought it would be better to make a video showing the differences, so that's what we've done for you today.

First, we teach the directional verbs 來 lai and 去 qu. Then we teach some direction complements that you can use with the verbs 來 lai and 去 qu which include 下, 上, 出, 进, 

For some extra points, you can check the Chinese Grammar Wiki links below.

This lesson is a bit more challenging and is meant to help Intermediate learners push up into the higher levels. The hope for this lesson is that you start seeing how sarcasm, cultural references, and historical figures can be used in a dialogue. It's fine if you don't remember everything from the lesson, but hopefully If you hear any of the statements in future, you will understand a bit more.

In this lesson, we hear a small argument between two friends that have fallen out because one of them embarrassed them in front of some girls that he liked.

Kids these days, particularly in China are super stressed. Not only do they have school most of the day, and homework that's not finished until late into the evening, but they also have lots of extracurricular classes that they must attend to stay ahead of the class.  

If you want to give you child the best start in life and not hold back their academic achievements, it seems that constant schooling is a must nowadays.  Listen to two adults discuss this trend, and how it was much easier back in the old days when you didn't need to force these academic pursuits.

Getting a sexual health check-up is an important thing you should do regularly if you are sexually active. Getting a check-up in a foreign country can be particularly stressful since you don't know any of the language or know who to ask for help. In this lesson we teach you some useful tips to get around this fear as well as some advice on what you might encounter during an STD/STI examination in the East. 

You probably won't find this lesson in any textbook, and it's not the kind of topic you will probably ask your language exchange partner, but fear not, We have you covered so that you stay clean and healthy.

In today's Qing Wen video lesson, we teach the Mandarin Chinese for the different ways to say ""probably."" 

Much like in English, using slightly different terms can change the likelihood of something happening, and in this lesson, we show you the three most common ways of expressing this. 大概 (dàgài) has the highest likelihood of something happening, 可能 (kěnéng) is about a 50% or higher chance, and 恐怕 (kǒngpà) is also likely to happen, but the important thing is not the percentage, but rather that the outcome is an undesirable event.  

A top tip is that the final word in 恐怕 (kǒngpà) has the character for ""scared"" in it, so you don't want this thing to happen. With 大概 (dàgài), dà means big, and gài means approximation, so a ""big likelihood.""

After today's lesson you should ""probably"" be a lot more confident when speaking Chinese, and you'll definitely know which one is most suitable for the situation.

If you have any questions, particularly about the rather tricky 恐怕 (kǒngpà), just leave a comment and we will try and get back to you."

I'm sure we have all pestered our parents asking them ""can I do this?"" or ""can I do that?"".In today's Newbie Mandarin lesson you will learn a really useful and highly repeated phrase for saying you can or cannot do something. 
In Chinese there are about 3 ways to say can, and in today's lesson we focus on the one that is used when asking for permission. For example, when asking if you can use the toilet, or if you can eat and drink on the subway. 
After the lesson you will be confident in knowing when to use which ""can"" word."

Today's Qing Wen takes a deeper look at the characters 能 (néng) 可以 (kěyǐ) and 会 (huì). These characters can all translate as ""can"" or ""be able to"" but when you actually come to compare the differences, it can get a bit tricky. 

Hopefully, this video will be helpful for elementary students for a general overview, as well as higher level learners who want to figure out which is best to use in certain situations.

Watch the video and make sure to look at all the example sentences."

上集“三条人命案”答案：
经查证，中年男性死者是吴国庆，中年女性死者名叫陈桂芝，青年男性死者叫吴奇。
吴奇的生日是闰年2月29日，所以5次生日之后，孩子应该是20岁出头。但在20多年里，吴奇基本没出过家门，所以长得很白净。因为赌博及其他各种原因，吴国庆经常对陈桂芝实施家庭暴力，吴奇也自然是看在眼中记在心里。案发前的两个礼拜，吴国庆与陈桂芝发生激烈争吵，并再一次发生家庭暴力，而吴奇乘吴国庆不注意的时候逃了出来。那天，吴国庆在实施暴力的过程中将陈桂芝杀死。两个礼拜后，案发的前一天晚上，吴奇半夜回到家中，向吴国庆询问母亲的下落，吴奇怀疑吴国庆将陈桂芝杀死并把尸体藏于地下室，之后发生了父子之间的打斗。因为唯一的钥匙在吴国庆手上，所以吴奇逼吴国庆将钥匙交出。吴国庆不肯，并把钥匙吞到肚子里。之后吴奇便把吴国庆杀死，并刨腹找出钥匙。进入地下室，找到母亲尸体后，吴奇便打开液化气瓶开关，在地下室自杀。"
