在这里跟大家分享一篇肖遥的专栏文章《人机合一》，这是发表在2017年的《三联生活周刊》上的一篇随笔，文字轻松明快，内容幽默有趣，下面，我们解析一下这篇1000字左右的文章。这篇文章，我们会分为四个部分进行解读，今天我们进行第一个部分的解读：

第一段主要讲了三种类型的办事员或公务员，老Q、小咪、小F，这三种人各自都有自己的特点：老Q是索要贿赂型，小咪是长相好，但态度不好的类型，小F惜墨如金型，他们代表了三种不负责任的公务人员，他们消极怠工，不热爱自己的工作，不愿耐心回答问询，对待顾客冷漠，还不如机器人。

第一段很容易理解，大意就是对一些官僚机构的办事效率慢，消极懈怠的工作态度，进行了生动的描述，希望我们都不要遇到这样的状况，也不要这样对待他人，希望大家都会被生活所善待，也学希望借着这篇文章我们也学会了怎么来应用这些词句。"

As of now, the majority of issues are resolved, but we are still working on fixing the rest, which you can follow here.

In order to fully resolve the issue, we are scheduling a maintenance session this coming Friday which will result in a much-improved experience afterwards.

This is actually something we have been wanting to do for some time, but it's just happening sooner rather than later.

The scheduled downtime to our website will be...

Friday, June 30th at 6 PM (UTC 8) to Saturday Morning 6 AM (UTC 8) 
During this time, the website and apps will not function.

We are sorry for this inconvenience but hope to have a much better service afterwards which will prevent problems like this from happening again.  If you have any comments or concerns, feel free to contact:

P.s. Apologies for posting this on the Qing Wen channel but it's the best way to ensure most people see it, including on our apps.

It's designed to ease Intermediate learners into the upper levels so might seem a bit easier than normal.


Getting the exact haircut that you want can sometimes be challenging, and might require some specialized language that you don't even know at the higher levels. Usually, it's best to take a picture of the style you want to avoid any confusion.

This lesson is a bit more challenging and is meant to help Intermediate learners push up into the higher levels. The hope for this lesson is that you start seeing how sarcasm, cultural references, and historical figures can be used in a dialogue. It's fine if you don't remember everything from the lesson, but hopefully If you hear any of the statements in future, you will understand a bit more.

In this lesson, we hear a small argument between two friends that have fallen out because one of them embarrassed them in front of some girls that he liked.

The 一 … 就 pattern (yī … jiù) is super common in Chinese grammar and is used to say that two actions happened in quick succession. For example: ""as soon as I got home, I called you"", or ""once I finished class, I began revising"".  

In today's example, it's a bit of a lovers tiff, where the girlfriend is upset that the boyfriend didn't call her. However, he claims that as soon as he finished work, he called right away.

 person
 time
 place
 doing what...

Starting today, ChinesePod have decided to try a different teaching methodology. Despite podcasting for over 10 years, our actual approach to teaching hasn't changed that much. 

But now EVERYTHING has changed! We have discovered something much better. 
Teaching using ASMR will not only speed up language acquisition, but will put you in a relaxed state of mind, ready to fall asleep and let your brain soak up the Chinese words. We recommend you don't take our classes while using heavy machinery, driving, or whilst cycling since you could fall asleep.

QW0417,How to Say 'Probably' in Chinese,Intermediate,Qing Wen,https://chinesepod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=QW0417,2016-01-15,True,https://s3contents.chinesepod.com/extra/QW0417/34045d9471835725c41e18c8c12b5a655ae5f94c/images/9205977ab0e19f4d620c2f28ba4e94e89405fa9f.jpg,"11:47      

In today's Qing Wen video lesson, we teach the Mandarin Chinese for the different ways to say ""probably."" 

Much like in English, using slightly different terms can change the likelihood of something happening, and in this lesson, we show you the three most common ways of expressing this. 大概 (dàgài) has the highest likelihood of something happening, 可能 (kěnéng) is about a 50% or higher chance, and 恐怕 (kǒngpà) is also likely to happen, but the important thing is not the percentage, but rather that the outcome is an undesirable event.  

A top tip is that the final word in 恐怕 (kǒngpà) has the character for ""scared"" in it, so you don't want this thing to happen. With 大概 (dàgài), dà means big, and gài means approximation, so a ""big likelihood.""

After today's lesson you should ""probably"" be a lot more confident when speaking Chinese, and you'll definitely know which one is most suitable for the situation.

If you have any questions, particularly about the rather tricky 恐怕 (kǒngpà), just leave a comment and we will try and get back to you."

经查证，中年男性死者是吴国庆，中年女性死者名叫陈桂芝，青年男性死者叫吴奇。
吴奇的生日是闰年2月29日，所以5次生日之后，孩子应该是20岁出头。但在20多年里，吴奇基本没出过家门，所以长得很白净。因为赌博及其他各种原因，吴国庆经常对陈桂芝实施家庭暴力，吴奇也自然是看在眼中记在心里。案发前的两个礼拜，吴国庆与陈桂芝发生激烈争吵，并再一次发生家庭暴力，而吴奇乘吴国庆不注意的时候逃了出来。那天，吴国庆在实施暴力的过程中将陈桂芝杀死。两个礼拜后，案发的前一天晚上，吴奇半夜回到家中，向吴国庆询问母亲的下落，吴奇怀疑吴国庆将陈桂芝杀死并把尸体藏于地下室，之后发生了父子之间的打斗。因为唯一的钥匙在吴国庆手上，所以吴奇逼吴国庆将钥匙交出。吴国庆不肯，并把钥匙吞到肚子里。之后吴奇便把吴国庆杀死，并刨腹找出钥匙。进入地下室，找到母亲尸体后，吴奇便打开液化气瓶开关，在地下室自杀。"

Not only is the film brilliant in its own unexpected way, but it is also a mere degree of separation from the Queen of Rock. So take a listen and see if you can figure out this week's mystery.
